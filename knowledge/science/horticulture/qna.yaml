      The objective of pruning is to produce strong, healthy, attractive plants.
      By understanding how, when and why to prune, and by following a few simple
      principles, this objective can be achieved.


      ## Why Prune


      The main reasons for pruning ornamental and shade trees include safety,
      health, and aesthetics. In addition, pruning can be used to stimulate
      fruit production and increase the value of timber. Pruning for safety
      (Fig. 1A) involves removing branches that could fall and cause injury or
      property damage, trimming branches that  interfere with lines of sight on
      streets or driveways, and removing branches that grow into utility lines.
      Safety pruning can be largely avoided by carefully choosing species that
      will not grow beyond the space available to them, and have strength and
      form characteristics that are suited to the site.

      All woody plants shed branches in response to shading and competition.
      Branches that do not produce enough carbohydrates from photosynthesis to
      sustain themselves die and are eventually shed; the resulting wounds are
      sealed by woundwood (callus). Branches that are poorly attached may be
      broken off by wind and accumulation of snow and ice. Branches removed by
      such natural forces often result in large, ragged wounds that rarely seal.
      Pruning as a cultural practice can be used to supplement or replace these
      natural processes and increase the strength and longevity of plants.

      Proper pruning cuts are made at a node, the point at which one branch or
      twig attaches to another.  In the spring of the year growth begins at
      buds, and twigs grow until a new node is formed.  The length of a branch
      between nodes is called an internode.

      Producing strong structure should be the emphasis when pruning young
      trees.  As trees mature, the aim of pruning will shift to maintaining tree
      structure, form, health and appearance.

      Branches with strong U-shaped angles of attachment should be retained (Fig
      3A). Branches with narrow, V-shaped angles of attachment often form
      included bark and should be removed (Fig. 3B). Included bark forms when
      two branches grow at sharply acute angles to one another, producing a
      wedge of inward-rolled bark between them. Included bark prevents strong
      attachment of branches, often causing a crack at the point below where the
      branches meet. Codominant stems that are approximately the same size and
      arise from the same position often form included bark.  Removing some of
      the lateral branches from a codominant stem can reduce its growth enough
      to allow the other stem to become dominant.
